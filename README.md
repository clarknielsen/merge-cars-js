# Merge Cars

Alternate version of a mini-game I originally made with Unity, located here: <https://clarknielsen.github.io/merge-cars/>.

This time made with JavaScript libraries, including three.js, TweenJS, and the Shader Particle Engine.

Play it here: <https://clarknielsen.github.io/merge-cars-js/>.
